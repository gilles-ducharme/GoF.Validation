		"A NEW SET OF TOOLS FOR GOODNESS-OF-FIT VALIDATION " 

by G.Ducharme and T. Ledwina (arXiv:2209.07295).

These programs are written in the Mathematica language , version 12.1.

Based on a new statistical quantity, the  comparison curve, the paper introduces two new tools to assess the validity of statistical distributions. 

The first tool is a graphical representation (the B-plot) of components which  can provide a detailed appraisal of validity. 
The associated subroutine is Bplot and can be used to produce most figures of the paper.

The second tool is a test  that  combines these components  to produce a powerful chi-square-type goodness-of-fit test of Gaussianity. Because the number of these components can be  large, 
a new selection rule allows  deciding on their number. The associated subroutine is NormalityTest.

See the README files associated with each programs for details.
