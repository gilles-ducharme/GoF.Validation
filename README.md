This program is assiciated with the work developped in the paper "A new set of tools for goodness-of-fit validation by Gilles R. Ducharme 
and Teresa Ledwina. 

The program computes the data driven chi-square - type test statistic for the null hypothesis of normality with unknown nuisance parameters
developped in Section 3,4 of that paper. It can be used to replicate the work regarding the examples in Section 3.5 as well as in Appendix A.
